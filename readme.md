Playing with Marionette JS
--------------------------
This is a base localStorage CRUD test using Marionette JS, Babel and Gulp.

CSS and chunks of the configs were taken from the [marionette-wires](https://github.com/thejameskyle/marionette-wires) example.

It uses [Backbone.localStorage](https://github.com/jeromegn/Backbone.localStorage) to persist the collection.
